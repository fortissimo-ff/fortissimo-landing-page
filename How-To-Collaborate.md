1) [Fork]() the fortissimo landing page repo by clicking on the "Fork" button at the top right-hand side of the repo and 
find a bug (e.g. code, documentation, accessibility, test coverage) or think of a quick question. 
For questions that require more lengthy discussions, join the [fortissimo discussion](https://github.com/orgs/fortissimo-ff/teams/tech-ninjas).

2) Raise an [issue](https://github.com/fortissimo-ff/fortissimo-landing-page/issues/new) by indicating a title for the new issue (the numbering of the issue with e.g. #1, #2, #3, #4, etc. is automatically generated), what the issue is, why is it an issue, what needs improvement or fixing, and what can be done to improve or fix it. Label the issue (e.g. bug, documentation, accessibility, test coverage). See [Raise Issue Template]()

3) Work on the improvement or fixture of each issue on a separate branch (label branch using issue number) and [send a pull request](https://github.com/fortissimo-ff/fortissimo-landing-page/compare) for review, 
comparing a new head branch of modifications with the base branch by selecting the associated issue number as the new head branch with the pull request. 
The issue number selected will be the title of the pull request. The commit message will contain reference to the issue number, the changes made, and the test plan (if any). 
The pull request will be labelled as **_high priority for easy fixes_**, **_medium priority for middle-of-the-road fixes_**, and **_low priorty for difficult fixes_**. 
See [Send Pull Request Template]()

4) Upon pull request review approval by the author or maintainers, status checks will be carried out. 
Pull request reviews are carried out in order of priority, with those labelled as 
**_high priority (easy fix)_** being reviewed before the **_medium priority (middle-of-the-road fix)_** and the **_low priority (difficult fix)_** pull requests.

5) Upon passing the status checks, the improvement or fixture will be merged with the master branch and the issue will be closed by the author or maintainers.
